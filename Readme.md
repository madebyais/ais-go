AIS-GO is a very simple boilerplate to create a web service based on MEGo (Mongodb Echo Golang) stack.

The structure is inspired by Uncle's Bob clean architecture. However, I've made a couple of changes to enable developer to read and use this boilerplate, and get started more easily.

### HOW-TO

Before you start, please make sure that you have install `glide` and `mongodb`. Afterward, please follow below steps.

1. Clone this project.
2. In current directory, execute `glide install`.
3. Last, `go run main.go`
